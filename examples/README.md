# Layr Example Plans

This directory contains example project plans generated using the Layr VS Code extension.

These files demonstrate the type of structured, actionable plans Layr produces when given natural language project descriptions. They are intended to help new users and contributors understand Layr’s capabilities and output format.

## Included Examples

- **todo-app-plan.md**  
  A simple to-do application with user authentication, task management, and persistent storage.

- **portfolio-website-plan.md**  
  A personal portfolio website showcasing projects, skills, experience, and contact information.

- **api-backend-plan.md**  
  A REST API backend for a blog platform with authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations.

## How These Examples Were Created

Each plan in this directory was generated directly using Layr’s **“Create Plan”** command in VS Code.  
The output was copied as-is without manual modification to accurately reflect what Layr produces.

## Purpose

- Help new users quickly understand what Layr can generate
- Provide realistic planning examples for common project types
- Serve as reference material for documentation and contributors

## Notes

- The content may vary slightly depending on model updates or configuration options.
- These examples are for reference only and can be customized for real projects.
